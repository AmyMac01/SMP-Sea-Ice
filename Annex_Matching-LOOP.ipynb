Profiles are divided in arbitrary layers of 5 cm and randomly scaled in thickness. A best fit candidate is selected where RMSE between the snow density estimates and observations are minimized. The matching process is used to account for differences in the target snowpack between the two methods. The example shown is for Eureka site 5 on MYI."
